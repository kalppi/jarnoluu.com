I have over 10 years of experience as a hobbyist programmer, and I'm a first year computer science student in University of Helsinki.

Over the years I have used many different languages and technologies, most important being Java, Javascript/Node, PHP, C# and HTML5+CSS. I have also dabbled a bit in C, C++ and Python. I have experience in graphical design as well.
